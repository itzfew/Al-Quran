    In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful.
    [1] Ya, Seen.
    [2] By the wise Qur'an.
    [3] Indeed you, [O Muhammad], are from among the messengers,
    [4] On a straight path.
    [5] [This is] a revelation of the Exalted in Might, the Merciful,
    [6] That you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, so they are unaware.
    [7] Already the word has come into effect upon most of them, so they do not believe.
    [8] Indeed, We have put shackles on their necks, and they are to their chins, so they are with heads [kept] aloft.
    [9] And We have put before them a barrier and behind them a barrier and covered them, so they do not see.
    [10] And it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them - they will not believe.
    [11] You can only warn one who follows the message and fears the Most Merciful unseen. So give him good tidings of forgiveness and noble reward.
